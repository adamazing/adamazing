# README++

This is designed to describe who I am, how I work, what I need, what I enjoy, what I expect from others, and what I want. The intention is that by being frank, direct, and open I can help others understand me, and how we can work best together.<br />

If we work together and you want to ask a question about anything in this document that you feel could help us work better together, please reach out to me on Slack.

## About Me

- I was born and grew up in the UK, where I met my Kiwi wife, Amy.
- I have lived in New Zealand since 2009.
- I have two children, Chloe (the eldest) and Oliver.
- I enjoy television and movies spanning many genres and styles, but love Studio Ghibli movies and the works of David Lynch.
- I love acting, especially in comedic roles.
- I have diagnosed ADHD and depression.

## My Role
I'm a Lead Developer (People Lead) at Flick Electric in the Enable Squad. I'm an Individual Contributor working within the squad under a Lead Developer (Tech Lead), but I also have direct reports for whose management and personal growth/development I'm responsible.


## My Philosophy On Work
My personal philosophy is one of kindness, empathy, and understanding. I want to leave the world better for my having lived. <br />

With this in mind I approach my work with good intentions and a sincere desire to do my best. I assume that everyone I work with is doing the same and I grant them the grace that I hope they will give to me. <br />

My health -- mental and physical -- and that of my family are my highest priorities. I endeavour to manage those priorities such that they do not impact on my work, but they will always take precedence.<br />

I will always encourage others to do the same.

## When & Where I Work

- I regularly work from a co-working space in Nelson, and from home, near Nelson.
- I travel to Flick's HQ in Wellington once every 1-2 months.
- I generally start between 8:30am and 9:00am and finish between 5:30pm and 6:00pm.

## Communication

- I can often find it difficult to digest verbal communication, and **prefer** written communications, or a combination of both.
  - Because of this I may often take notes when talking, even 1 on 1.
  - I'm aware that -- especially since I'm working remotely -- this may make it seem like I'm distracted but it forces me to focus more keenly on your words/meaning, as well as giving me a resource to look back on.
- I find it difficult to maintain eye contact with people -- especially in person. Please don't be offended if that makes me seem distracted.

### Meetings
My ADHD can sometimes cause me to hyper-focus on a specific task, causing me to become engrossed in the current thing I'm working on to the exclusion of all else. So:
- I work incredibly hard to avoid being late to meetings by using (loud) reminders. Apologies if this is annoying when I am co-located with you and I am not wearing headphones.
- If I am late I would be incredibly grateful if you could give me some grace.
- If you prod me on Slack in private or in public that I should be in a meeting, I will not be offended, but grateful.

As is almost customary for developers, I work from a laptop connected to larger screens which are to the side of my laptop's camera.
- I often have the meeting content/video on the larger screen and will focus on that and, if I am taking notes they may also be on the larger screen.
  - I am present in the meeting and focussing in the best way I can to ensure that I retain the information discussed.
- I do make efforts to keep looking at the camera as much as possible for others' benefit, when I remember.


### Slack
- This is my **primary** and **preferred** channel for communication.
- Unless the situation absolutely requires it, I prefer communication take place in an open/public channel (such as the Squad/Project channel).
- As a remote worker, I understand that it's harder to establish whether or not I am available. As such, I endeavour to answer slack messages within a very short time of receipt unless:
  - I am in a meeting; or
  - I am intently focussed on a specific issue.<br />
 Both of these will be clearly indicated in my Google Calendar.
- I will endeavour to ensure that my Slack status reflects accurately whether I am online or offline.

### Email
- Email is my least preferred channel for communication.
- I check email at least two or three times a day, but if your question requires an urgent response, Slack is preferred.

## ADHD & Depression
I'm aware of the stigma and taboo around discussing mental health issues and neurodivergent diagnoses but I feel that it is important to talk about my own for three reasons:
  1. as a way to help others understand me and the way I work;
  2. so that others in a similar situation can feel seen; and
  3. to normalise discussions of mental health as much as discussions of physical health.
