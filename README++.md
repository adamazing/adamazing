# README++

## What this is

This is designed to describe who I am, how I work, what I need, what I enjoy, what I expect from others, and what I want. The intention is that by being frank, direct, and open I can help others understand me, and how we can work best together.

## What this is not

This is not intended - or expected - to absolve me of responsibility for my behaviour, nor should it! üôÇ

## Continuous improvement

This document is as much a work-in-progress as I am. If we work together and you want to ask a question about anything in this document that you feel could help us work better together, please reach out to me on Slack.<br />

## About me

- I was born and grew up in the UK, where I met my Kiwi wife, Amy.
- I have lived in New Zealand since 2009.
- I have two children, Chloe (the eldest) and Oliver.
- I enjoy television and movies spanning many genres and styles, but love Studio Ghibli movies and the works of David Lynch.
- I love acting, especially in comedic roles.
- I have diagnosed ADHD and depression.

## My role
I'm a Lead Developer (People Lead) at Flick Electric in the DevEx Squad. I'm an Individual Contributor working within the squad under a Lead Developer (Tech Lead), but I also have direct reports for whose management and personal growth/development I'm responsible.


## My philosophy on work
My personal philosophy is one of kindness, empathy, and understanding. I want to leave the world better for my having lived. <br />

With this in mind I approach my work with good intentions and a sincere desire to do my best. I assume that everyone I work with is doing the same and I grant them the grace that I hope they will give to me. <br />

My health -- mental and physical -- and that of my family are my highest priorities. I endeavour to manage those priorities such that they do not impact on my work, but they will always take precedence.

## When & where I work

- I regularly work from a co-working space in Nelson, and from home, near Nelson.
- I travel to Flick's HQ in Wellington once every 1-2 months.
- I generally start between 8:30am and 9:00am and finish between 5:30pm and 6:00pm.

## Communication

- I can often find it difficult to digest verbal communication, and **prefer** written communications, or a combination of both.
  - Because of this I may often take notes when talking, even 1 on 1.
  - I'm aware that -- especially since I'm working remotely -- this may make it seem like I'm distracted but it forces me to focus more keenly on your words/meaning, as well as giving me a resource to look back on.
- I can sometimes find it very difficult to maintain eye contact with people -- especially in person. Please don't be offended if that makes me seem distracted.
- I appreciate candor, and have lived enough years to be able to take criticism without taking it personally.  
- I want to do better and I really value constructive criticism as a tool to enable that.

### Meetings
My ADHD can sometimes cause me to hyper-focus on a specific task, causing me to become engrossed in the current thing I'm working on to the exclusion of all else. So:
- I work incredibly hard to avoid being late to meetings by using (loud) reminders. Apologies if this is annoying when I am co-located with you and I am not wearing headphones.
- If I am late I would be incredibly grateful if you could give me some grace.
- If you prod me on Slack in private or in public that I should be in a meeting, I will not be offended, but grateful.

As is almost customary for developers, I work from a laptop connected to larger screens which are to the side of my laptop's camera.
- I often have the meeting content/video on the larger screen and will focus on that and, if I am taking notes they may also be on the larger screen.
  - I am present in the meeting and focussing in the best way I can to ensure that I retain the information discussed.
- I do make efforts to keep looking at the camera as much as possible for others' benefit, when I remember.

### Documentation
<div style="margin-bottom:1em; text-align: center">I ‚ù§Ô∏è documentation.</div>
  
I am very passionate about the importance and value of up-to-date and accurate written, videographical, pictorial, or diagrammatical documentation. This is in no small part due to it being a method of communication that I prefer üòÖ.  

A written document can be searched, and re-read -- slowly or quickly depending on the reader's preference/ability. Markdown documents can be presented/rendered, or read and digested raw using any application capable of displaying text.  

Diagrams can communicate even extremely complicated subjects easily. A picture is worth a thousand words. A good sequence diagram is worth a million. 

Loom videos and meeting recordings are also great, in that they can be time-shifted, paused, played at a faster or slower rate, and can be subtitled. 

### Slack

- This is my **primary** and **preferred** channel for communication.
- Unless the situation absolutely requires it, I prefer communication take place in an open/public channel (such as a Squad/Project/Topic-specific channel).
- As a remote worker, I understand that it's harder to establish whether or not I am available. As such, I endeavour to answer slack messages within a very short time of receipt unless:
  - I am in a meeting; or
  - I am intently focussed on a specific issue.<br />
 Both of these should be clearly indicated in my Google Calendar.
- I will endeavour to ensure that my Slack status and Google Calendar reflect accurately whether I am online or offline.

### Email

- Email is a less preferred channel for communication but appreciate that it is sometimes the best medium for official communications and announcements.
- I check email at least two or three times a day, but if your question requires an urgent response, Slack is preferred.

## ADHD & Depression

I'm aware of the stigma and taboo around discussing mental health issues and neurodivergent diagnoses but I feel that it is important to talk about my own for three reasons:
  1. as a way to help others understand me and the way I work;
  2. so that others in a similar situation can feel seen; and
  3. to normalise discussions of mental health in the workplace.

It's important to understand that ADHD/Anxiety/Autism/Depression are just labels that, for better or worse, are used to bucket *people* -- we who exist in all of our weird and wondrous ways on a variety of spectra -- into convenient classes. 
As significantly large sub-types of each grouping are recognised as being distinct and as those groups are better understood, they may get their own labels.

Which is to say that my ADHD, my anxiety, and my depression may be different to yours, or the next person's. Just as my blue eyes may not be the same as another person's blue eyes. I can only speak to my own experiences and identity and what I have shared should not be assumed to apply to anyone else.

### Depression

I've experienced social anxiety, generalised anxiety, and depression to some degree since I was 10 or 11 which was diagnosed properly only after a serious depressive episode that coincided with a bereavement in my late 20s. 
Until then, while I was aware of depression and had seen how it had manifested in close friends and family, I hadn't put that name to the low moods and feelings I had experienced until then. 
Like many people, I now take medication every day (and have done for a decade) to support the chemical imbalance in my brain that feeds/encourages depressive thoughts and anxiety. 

### ADHD

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 41. Again, despite the late diagnosis, I have been affected by a variety of symptoms/traits associated with ADHD (and Autism) since I was very young. 
I didn't associate "ADHD" with the issues I faced because I was stuck on the typical stereotype of a disruptive, hyperactive schoolboy. It wasn't until other people I knew started talking about their own ADHD/neurodivergent traits and diagnoses that 
I even considered it as an explanation for the issues and struggles I had faced and which I had just assumed were "normal".

### How ADHD affects the way I work

Having been diagnosed I am now taking medication to try and mitigate/alleviate some of the ways ADHD can affect me at work. I've found that the medication I take dramatically reduces the most impactful symptoms of ADHD but for whatever reason, they don't completely abate for me.   

Without medication, the symptoms that make working the hardest are:  
 - **Executive dysfunction**  
   This is the inability to start tasks. In addition to the relief that medication offers, there are also tools/mental framings that help me with this. 
   Being able to find and identify a single small thread to pull to get started on a task/story is a really good one. Other people think of it like the washing up; if there's so much you don't know where to start, start with the spoons. 
   Think "what is 'the spoons' of this task?".

   This is different from "laziness". It can feel like a kind of paralysis, being trapped and unable to do a task/activity, while my brain torments me for not starting the activity, feeding my anxiety and depression.
   As someone I know said "If it was laziness, it wouldn't stop me doing things I wanted to do". Indeed, when it happens, it's just as likely to stop me doing an activity I enjoy as a task at work.

 - **Hyper-focus**  
   The flip-side of being unable to start a task. üòÖ Getting so intensely focused on a task/topic/thread that I forget about everything else and find it almost impossible to put it down. 

   From what I have read this is due to ADHDs effect on the brain's ability to produce dopamine, so that when the brain finds a new source of it, such as the right-kind-of-challenging problem on a story, it can't get enough of it. 

Other symptoms and how they might affect you:
 - **Stimming**  
   *Self-stimulatory behaviour*, or *stimming* is the repetition of physical movements, sounds, moving objects, or other repetitive behaviours. They can be a protective response to overstimulation or as a way to relieve anxiety, or other negative or heightened emotions. 
   Examples of stimming behaviours might be bouncing your knee up and down, twiddling your pen, biting your lip/nails, sucking your hair etc.. They are often subconscious and compulsive.  

   I have done or do all of the above at various times. If I'm co-located with you and my leg-bouncing or pen-twiddling annoys you, *please* let me know. üôá
