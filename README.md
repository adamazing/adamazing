### Hi I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Developer with People Leading experience based in Nelson, New Zealand and I'm currently looking for remote work with a preference for positions based in NZ. 
Most recently I worked at Flick Electric using Ruby on Rails, AWS, and Terraform but I've worked in a variety of disparate fields with many different tools, languages, and frameworks.  

When I'm not "on the clock" I enjoy exploring other tools and frameworks, and playing Zachtronics games. 
I care passionately about creating fun and:w
inclusive software and workplaces and would love to work with others who feel the same.
